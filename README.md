# 💎 Sui NFT DApp

## Overview
**Sui NFT DApp** is a decentralized application built on the **Sui Blockchain** using the **Move language**, created during a workshop held in Chennai. This dApp allows users to **mint, burn, transfer, and manage ownership of NFTs** seamlessly on the Sui network.  

The project leverages **@mysten/create-dapp** to set up a modern React-based frontend with TypeScript, Vite, and pre-built UI components, enabling a smooth and interactive user experience.
